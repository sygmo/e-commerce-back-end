# E-commerce Back End

Developer: Sydney Mercier

For: UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

## Overview

The task for this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying given starter code. The end result is a working Express API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. While the server code was provided in the starter code, the models, their associations, and the routes to perform CRUD operations were all implemented by me. The demo below shows the routes being tested in Insomnia.
